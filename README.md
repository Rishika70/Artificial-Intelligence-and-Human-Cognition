## ðŸš€ Overview   
  
This paper explores Human cognition and AI through **post-quantum theory**, **entropy-driven intelligence**, and **neural entanglement**, we hypothesize that **cognitive processes mirror quantum field interactions**, potentially allowing AI to **learn and generalize** like humans.  

## ðŸ”¬ Core Concepts  
- **Quantum-Inspired AI:** Mimicking cognitive processes through entanglement-based neural representations.  
- **Neural Entanglement:** Studying correlated neural activations that may influence learning.  
- **Quantum Decoherence & Attention:** Investigating how focus correlates with sustained quantum states in the brain.  
- **Dark Matter & Dark Energy in Cognition:** Mapping unconscious processes (dark energy) and latent cognitive structures (dark matter) to neural architecture.
